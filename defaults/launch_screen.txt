You are playing a text-based cafe simulator game.
You have an inventory, a wallet, and a recipe book.
    - inventory will contain an item and a count associated with item: start = None
        - there is a max amount of items you can have in the inventory
    - wallet will have money in usd: start = 15 (default)
    - recipe book will have some recipes: default recipe book is loaded if not specified

Your goal is to serve customers some food by following the recipe book.
Customers will arrive at an interval (default 45 seconds).
However fast you make it will determine the tip that they give you.
The recipe book will have the ingredients needed to make the recipe.
Ingredients can be found in the pantry (loaded with default ingredients) or from the store.

At the start, you are in the cafe where you can:
    - make foods
    - open pantry
    - go to store
There is a counter where you must set ingredients on to make the food itself.
The counter also has a max capacity and to free space, you can always place things in the pantry.
The inventory should be the medium to transfer between pantry and counter

At the store, you must ask for the price of an ingredient first before buying it.
You can check prices and your cart.
When done shopping, you can checkout.

If at any point, you don't know what to do, just type 'help' and there will be a list
of commands that you can perform.
